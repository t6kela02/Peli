Ughh, my butt hurts… What is this smell?
it’s like a combination of grass and cinnamon.
I feel weird, similar to waking up after 13 hours of sleep
and then stepping into a pool of apple juice.
Oh darn, I can’t see anything!
Am I going blind??? 
Oh wait my eyes are shut, should probably open them. 
Where am I?
Let’s wander around and see if 
I can find something that makes sense.
